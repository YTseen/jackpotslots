How to run locally:
- Open index.html in Chrome or add as a browser source in OBS.
- All assets must remain in the 'images' and 'fonts' folders.
- You can edit index.html to change the game list or adjust visuals as you like.

For OBS:
- Add a new browser source, and use the 'file://.../index.html' path to this folder.
